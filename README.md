## JavaScript 
JavaScript is considered to be a cilent side language which runs in a browser but with the time there has been a lot of development in its library and environment to support different development need.

Earlier server side query were wrapped into SQL and PHP to talk to the server but now Node JS can make JavaScript code to run on server side.

### Compatibilities of JS

|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Node JS                             | Allow JS to run on server side                                             |
| React Native                        | Cross platform mobile app development                                      |
| Angular JS                          | Framework for Mobile and Desktop development                               |

### What is ES6/ES7
**ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) and ES7 (ECMAScript 2016) refer to versions of the ECMAScript language specification, which is the standard upon which JavaScript is based. Each version introduces new features and improvements to the language.**

ES6 brought major new features such as classes, modules, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and more, significantly enhancing the language.

ES7 added the exponentiation operator and the Array.prototype.includes method, making it easier to work with arrays and perform exponentiation.
These updates made JavaScript more powerful and easier to write
